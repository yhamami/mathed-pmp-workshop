**Colin Foster (Loughborough University): _Teaching problem solving in school mathematics_**

In school mathematics curricula across many parts of the world, the practice of ‘problem
solving’ has a high profile. Teachers are exhorted to prepare students for the modern world
by equipping them with the skills needed to devise creative solutions to novel (i.e. ‘unseen’)
mathematical problems. However, ‘problem solving’ has multiple definitions in the
literature and it is unclear what exactly is meant by ‘teaching it’. In this talk, I will outline
what I have called ‘the fundamental problem of teaching problem solving’; i.e., showing
students how to solve the problem kills the problem and degrades it into an exercise,
whereas leaving students to struggle to discover their own solutions feels like not ‘teaching’.
At Loughborough University, I am currently leading a team designing a complete, free set of
teaching resources for lower secondary mathematics (the LUMEN Curriculum – see
https://www.lboro.ac.uk/services/lumen/curriculum/). As part of this, we are promising the
teaching of ‘problem solving’, and I will outline our emerging framework for what this might
look like. I would be very grateful for comment and critique on any of this.

**Karen François (Vrije Universiteit Brussel): _The interaction between philosophy of mathematical practices and mathematics education : concept
clarification and exemplar_**

During this presentation I’ll clarify the concept of mathematics education by giving a brief overview
of the different domains including (civic) statistics and (big) data education; and how it differs from
philosophy of mathematics education (Francois, 2007). In a second move I’ll introduce the
forerunners of philosophy of mathematics education focussing on (chronological order) D’Ambrosio
(1985), Bishop (1988), Ernest (1991), and Hersh (1997). I finally will introduce the ongoing research
with Joachim Frans on ‘Explanatory Proofs in Mathematics Classroom Practices’ as an exemplar of a
fruitful interaction between philosophy of mathematical practices and mathematics education (Frans& Francois 2023).

**Gila Hanna (University of Toronto): _Interactive theorem provers in mathematical practice and teaching_**

As interactive theorem provers become more user-friendly and gain wider acceptance in mathematical practice, it is important to explore their use as an additional instructional tool. I will discuss current research on using the interactive theorem prover Lean in teaching undergraduate students to construct and understand mathematical proofs.  

**Matthew Inglis (Loughborough University): _The relationship between the philosophy of mathematical practice and mathematics education_**

In this talk I discuss how we do, and how we should, conceive of the relationship between the disciplines of mathematics education (ME) and the philosophy of mathematical practice (PMP). To do this I first review some literature on interdisciplinarity, and then give a personal history of the development of mathematical cognition as a research field. Using this as one model of how interdisciplinary fields emerge, I discuss some possible options for the future of the PMP/ME relationship.

**Brendan Larvor (University of Hertfordshire): **

**Ellen Lehet (Lees-McRae College): **

**Dirk Schlimm (McGill University): **

**Nathalie Sinclair (Simon Fraser University): _Aesthetic considerations in mathematics education (research)_**

Many scholars have argued that aesthetics play a significant role in the practice of mathematics. I have been interested in how these arguments matter in the context of mathematics education. In this talk, I will survey some of the different ways in which the concept of aesthetics has been used, both historically in mathematics-related research, but also in more contemporary philosophical scholarship. I will present an inclusive materialist view of aesthetics and describe examples of how it has been used in mathematics education research.
